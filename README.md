##  Architecture

EcoLens uses a **Hierarchical Agentic RAG System**:

1. **Query Decomposition**  
   Complex user prompts are broken down into sub-questions.

2. **CRAG Loop**  
   Each sub-question invokes a retrieval-grade-generate pipeline.

3. **Conditional Web Search**  
   Web search is only triggered if retrieved documents are insufficient.

4. **Consolidation**  
   All sub-answers are merged using a JSON-constrained final generation step.

5. **Location Integration**  
   Optional lat/long values personalize responses for regional relevance.
